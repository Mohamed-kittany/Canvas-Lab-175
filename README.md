# AWS Auto Scaling Lab Using Linux

## Lab Overview

This lab provides a hands-on experience with AWS Auto Scaling using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). You'll set up an Amazon EC2 instance configured as a web server and create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from this instance. This AMI will serve as the template for launching multiple EC2 instances that automatically scale according to the load. Additionally, you will configure an Elastic Load Balancer to evenly distribute incoming traffic across the EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones.
